# HR_Employees_Report
This project focuses on data cleaning and analysis using MySQL Workbench and Power BI. The main goal is to demonstrate how to perform data cleaning tasks, utilize subqueries and filters, and generate meaningful insights from the data. The project involves working with a dataset in MySQL and visualizing the results in Power BI through a simple dashboard.
# Technologies Used:
MySQL Workbench
Power BI
# Project Steps:
Data Cleaning in MySQL: The project begins with data cleaning tasks in MySQL Workbench. This involves addressing issues such as missing values, inconsistent formatting. Techniques for converting dates and handling null values are demonstrated.

Data Analysis in MySQL: Using SQL queries, various analysis tasks are performed on the cleaned dataset. This may include aggregations, filtering and sorting to extract valuable insights from the data.

Exporting Query Results: The query results obtained from the MySQL database are exported as CSV files. This allows for further utilization of the data in subsequent steps, such as visualization in Power BI.

Creating a Power BI Dashboard: The exported CSV files are imported into Power BI to create a simple and intuitive dashboard. The dashboard incorporates visualizations, charts, and graphs to present the analyzed data in an easily understandable format.
